				<h2>What is it?</h2>
				<p>Rubber Ducky is your helper in any tough situation. Are you desperate for a solution to your problem? Searching for an answer for a long time? Lost in a huge amount of information? You probably haven't tried talking to Rubber Ducky! Just explain your problem in detail... and you will find a solution! Magic? No. It's Rubber Ducky!</p>
				<h2>How to use it?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Be as specific as possible, or Ducky might not understand you.</li>
					<li>Don’t leave out details, even the sensitive ones. This duck’s memory is not very good anyway.</li>
					<li>Talk to Ducky like a human would talk to a human. Ducks have feelings too!</li>
					<li>While explaining your problem, you will definitely find some useful insights.</li>
					<li>While reading through your writing, you might even find a complete solution.</li>
					<li>If nothing still comes to your mind, you can go to a walk and then return to your problem with the fresh head. All your notes will be saved.</li>
